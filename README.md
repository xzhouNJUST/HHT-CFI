# Heterogeneous Hypergraph Transformer Network with Cross-modal Future Interaction for Multi-Agent Trajectory Prediction (HHT-CFI)

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for our paper: **"Heterogeneous Hypergraph Transformer Network with Cross-modal Future Interaction for Multi-Agent Trajectory Prediction"**. 

We are committed to open science and will release the full implementation of our HHT-CFI, including:
- Model architecture
- Training and evaluation scripts

### ðŸ“¢ **Code Release Timeline**
The code and additional resources will be made publicly available once the paper is accepted.
